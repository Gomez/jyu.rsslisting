jyu.rsslisting
**************************

This is a version which works for me, means you normally dont need it!

Changes - Version 1.1:

- accept the feedparser.CharacterEncodingOverride exception when parsing the feed as it is just a warning: the parsed entries will be there
- Switch to disable the HTML Strip
- HTML Code in the description field

ToDo:

- Move the Switch to a propertie / configlet
